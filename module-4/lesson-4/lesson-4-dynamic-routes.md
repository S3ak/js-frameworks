# Lesson 3 - Dynamic routes

# Dynamic routes

We want each individual game to appear at a path like this: http://localhost:3000/people/person-id

To set up a dynamic route for this we create a path with square brackets, a folder called game and then a file in the game folder called [slug].js

We are updating the component to return a list of links pointing to a people/slug path.

[slug].js
The code in [slug].js is going to have 3 parts
