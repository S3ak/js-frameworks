# Lesson 2 - Styling a React app

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is popular at the moment and is basically a library of utility classes that you add to your HTML elements or React components.

Depending on how you like to work, it can be an efficient way to style projects though you do end up with a lot of classes in your markup/JSX.

It will take a little while to get to know the class names, but once you do know them you should be able to style your components quickly wihout having to write too much of your own CSS.

[Here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) are the official docs on adding Tailwind to a Create React App.

You will need to use [CRACO](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco) to add the extra configuration (this is covered in the docs).
